Wow, David! Your app feels very fluid. It has a lot of those subtle interactive features which make it feel dynamic and responsive. It invites you to interact with it! Your work with Material UI clearly paid off, and I'm sure the next time it will be that much easier to put things together.

### Notes:
Nailed all the base and stretch requirements. I'm really impressed David! Beautiful work!

Once very small bit of UI feedback: the comments section on the review page is interactive in
a way that makes me think that I should be able to edit or change my comments from there (hover effect, changes blue on click). I think it would be more clear to the user that it is simply a read only display if the interactive animations were turned off in this view.
